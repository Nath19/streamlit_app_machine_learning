# Welcome to Streamlit ðŸ‘‹

**The fastest way to build custom ML tools.**

Streamlit lets you create apps for your machine learning projects with deceptively simple Python scripts. It supports hot-reloading, so your app updates live as you edit and save your file. No need to mess with HTTP requests, HTML, JavaScript, etc. All you need is your favorite editor and a browser. 





## Installation

```
pip install streamlit
streamlit hello
```

## Example

Streamlit lets you build interactive apps ridiculously easily:

```
import streamlit as st

x = st.slider('Select a value')
st.write(x, 'squared is', x * x)
```

## A Bigger Example

Despite its simplicity Streamlit lets you build incredibly rich and powerful tools. [This demo project](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving) lets you browse the entire [Udacity self-driving-car dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car) and run inference in real time using the [YOLO object detection net](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo).

The complete demo is implemented in less than 300 lines of Python. In fact, the app contains [only 23 Streamlit calls](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/blob/master/app.py) which illustrates all the major building blocks of Streamlit. You can try it right now with:

```
pip install --upgrade streamlit opencv-python
streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/master/app.py
```
